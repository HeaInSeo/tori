# tori Constitution

<!--
  ②-form (D-12): this file does NOT own cross-repo invariants. It references the
  platform canonical constitution and indexes only THIS repo's own enforced
  constraints. SoT for those is the rules themselves (Makefile gates / CI), not
  this prose.
-->

## Cross-repo invariants live in the platform canonical (NodeVault §4)

Cross-repo invariants — reproducibility, `casHash`, `stableRef`, the artifact
dual-axis (`lifecycle_phase` / `integrity_health`), the sori boundary, and the
image-build / ResolveRecipe rules — are owned solely by the platform canonical:
**`github.com/HeaInSeo/NodeVault` — `docs/PLATFORM_MASTER_DESIGN.md` §4**
(immutable architecture decisions). This document does not restate or fork
them; on any conflict, §4 wins.

## Process discipline (repo-operational — owned by this repo)

- **Deterministic gates are the guarantee.** Merge is decided by deterministic
  checks (tests, gosec, govulncheck, golangci-lint). LLM/agent review is
  **advisory**: a passing review never merges alone, a failing gate is never
  overridden.
- **Spec-anchored change**; **test-first** (behavioral changes ship with tests
  that fail before / pass after; `make test` runs the race-enabled variant);
  **Builder/Critic separation** (read-only Critic pass before merge).
- **Local verify (before a PR):**
  `make test lint lint-security-check vuln-check`.
- **Branch protection**: `master` lands via PR with required checks; no direct
  pushes.
- **Agent guidance**: see `AGENTS.md` for this repo's agent-operational
  guidance. This constitution does not duplicate or supersede it.

## Repo-local enforced constraints (derived index — NOT canonical)

> Derived index of THIS repo's own gates. Not canonical — SoT is the gate itself.

- **gosec** (IMPLEMENTED — `make lint-security-check`): static security analysis, blocking.
- **govulncheck** (IMPLEMENTED — `make vuln-check`): vulnerability scan, blocking.
- **golangci-lint** (IMPLEMENTED — `make lint`): lint gate.
- **race tests** (IMPLEMENTED — `make test`, `go test -race -shuffle=on`): concurrency safety.

## §1.10 — "do not record what you did not observe"

**Status: PROPOSED (not enforced in this repo).** §1.10 is a cross-repo
rule (not yet part of NodeVault §4); tori has **no deterministic rule** enforcing it
today. Marked PROPOSED, not IMPLEMENTED, until such a gate exists.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-08-02 | **Last Amended**: 2026-08-02
